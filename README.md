# Auto-Authenticate Script for AZERTY Keyboard

## Description / auto-authenticate folder
This Python script automates the process of entering a password into a pop-up authentication window on a system using a French AZERTY keyboard layout. It periodically checks for the presence of the pop-up window and, if detected, automatically fills in the password and clicks the authentication button.
